known_limitations:
  - issue: Navigation is state-based, no URL routes; all views reached via tab bar and buttons
    location: contexts/AppContext.tsx
    impact: TestSprite must interact with UI elements to navigate, not URL navigation
  - issue: Data stored in localStorage, no backend API
    location: services/storageService.ts
    impact: No API calls to test; all data is client-side
